# AmazonWebScraper


Purely it's for Educational purpose only

Hi All,

I have done a scraping project in AmazonWeb where I have scraped the Product Name and the number of Ratings that the product has reached. It's very useful for persons who have engaged in amazon as individual sellers and also dealing with a wide range of products.

For count, I have fixed to 50 and it can pushed according to the business scale and on real time basis the Spreadsheet is updated. So that the user can have a look on it. It can also be done with pricing depending upon the policy of the company.It is aslo very useful for professionals like Product Researchers and also the Students.

I have also done a method for getting an email when the product hits the desired targets of ratings.

I have structured my codes in detail for clear understanding.

Thanks to all the individual for sharing their knowledge with me.
